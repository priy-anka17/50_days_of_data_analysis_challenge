# 50 Days 50 Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my 50 Days 50 Data Analysis Project! Over the course of this project, I will be dedicating 10 days to each of the following data analysis tools: Python, Power BI, SQL, Tableau, and Excel. The goal is to explore and enhance my skills in each of these areas.

## Project Overview

The project will be divided into five phases, with each phase focusing on one of the selected tools:

1. **Python**
2. **Power BI**
3. **SQL**
4. **Tableau**
5. **Excel**

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each tool. Within each folder, you will find the scripts, notebooks, or visualizations related to the respective tool.

## Contribution

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or would like to contribute, feel free to submit issues or pull requests.

## Table of Contents

1. [Python](#python)
2. [Power BI](#power-bi)
3. [SQL](#sql)
4. [Tableau](#tableau)
5. [Excel](#excel)

## Python

In this phase, I will be focusing on data analysis using Python. The tasks will include setting up a Python environment, exploring basic syntax, and utilizing libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.

## Power BI

During the Power BI phase, I will be creating insightful dashboards and reports. This involves data loading, transformation, and visualization within the Power BI environment.

## SQL

The SQL phase will cover writing and optimizing SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation. I will explore database interactions and gain a deeper understanding of relational databases.

## Tableau

In the Tableau phase, I will create visually appealing and interactive data visualizations. The focus will be on leveraging Tableau's features to communicate insights effectively.

## Excel

The Excel phase will involve utilizing advanced data analysis techniques within Excel. This includes formulas, pivot tables, and other functionalities to extract meaningful insights from the data.
